# 🌤️ Weather App

A responsive weather web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It fetches real-time weather data using the [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/), and displays the current conditions along with an hourly forecast.

> **Note:** This app works from local files but may not work when directly hosted from GitHub due to API key and CORS restrictions.
